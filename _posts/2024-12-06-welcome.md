Hey, most of you probably don't know me which is why I figured this first post would be a little introduction. My name's Aakash.
I'm a first year computer science student at the University of New South Wales. Just finished high school last year and I'm about
to enter my second year of university. I like to write creatively a lot and I enjoy playing video games with the boys and playing
cricket. Kinda average hobby list I know but ay, I didn't know what else to write. Anywho, this github page was inspired by Dhruv
Agarwal's page where he posts course reviews and stuff and frankly, it would be super cool if I had my own page on my linkedin
or whatever. I'll post whenever something interesting happens in my life as well as of course the course reviews. I'm not a very
gifted student so these reviews are from the eyes of the ordinary. I will get HDs though.
